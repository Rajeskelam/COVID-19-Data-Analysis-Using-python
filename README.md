# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-python
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to understand how confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries evolved over time across different countries. The goal is to extract meaningful insights using data analytics techniques and present them through visualizations and summary statistics.

The analysis covers key metrics such as:

Monthly and daily confirmed case trends

Country-wise comparison of total and average daily deaths

Growth patterns based on cumulative data

Identifying top affected regions

Highlighting anomalies and reporting inconsistencies

This project demonstrates practical skills in Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes global COVID-19 records with fields like:

date

country

confirmed

deaths

recovered

cumulative_confirmed

cumulative_deaths

🛠️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning

Handled missing values

Formatted date columns

Removed duplicates

Standardized country names

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed essential breakdowns such as:

Monthly sum of confirmed cases

Total deaths per country

Top 5 countries with highest daily average deaths

Trends using cumulative data

Country-wise spikes and decline patterns

3️⃣ Visualizations

Built clear charts using Matplotlib/Seaborn:

Line charts for monthly trends

Bar charts for top affected countries

Heatmaps for continent or country clusters

Cumulative growth curves

4️⃣ Insights & Findings

Summarized key takeaways such as:

Which countries had the fastest growth

Patterns in daily vs. cumulative deaths

Time periods of highest infection spikes
